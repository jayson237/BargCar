# BargCar

Barg Car is an online car rental company with physical offices where cars are parked and maintained. Customers can register online, select a car model, choose a pickup location, and book a rental for a specific number of days, making a payment via credit card. The company assigns a specific car if it is available, ensuring it is not already rented or damaged. Customers may also hire a driver for consecutive days during their rental. Upon pickup, an employee hands over the car keys, and upon return at any location, the keys are collected by another employee. If returned to a different location, the car will be moved back to its original office overnight.

The rental cost is calculated based on the number of days booked, with a fixed daily price and a deposit. Even if the car is returned early, customers are charged for the full booking duration. If the rental cost is lower than the deposit, the difference is refunded; otherwise, the customer pays the excess amount. For example, if a car rented at $200 per day for four days is returned early, the cost is still $800, and $700 of the $1500 deposit is refunded.
